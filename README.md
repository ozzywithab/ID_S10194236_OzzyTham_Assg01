# ID Personal Portfolio Project

This website is for my an ID Project. The website will be a personal portfolio for myself to be shown to recuiters that are considering hiring me, presenting myself in my best light to get recruited.

## Design process

When designing my portfolio, I looked at other people's portfolio and made a design which I thought looked proffessional and minimalistic. On the very top of the page is a navigation bar for users to access other parts of my HTML.

## Features

*Navigation bar - On every page and allows user to navigate between the 3 HTML sites without a link

*Feedback form - Users can send me feedback through the last page of the website by filing up a form

#### index.html

The index page is also my About me page and includes information about myself and some of my skills

#### Education.html

The education page displays my previous schools and past academic achievements in the respective schools that I attended

#### Contact.html

The contact page includes my contact information and a form

## Technology used

*@media() - Used to change certain CSS styles so elements of the HTML page would adapt to a smaller browser

## Media

*All photos used were personal
