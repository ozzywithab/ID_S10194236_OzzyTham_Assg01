# ID Personal Portfolio Project

This website is for my an ID Project. The website will be a personal portfolio for myself to be shown to recuiters that are considering hiring me, presenting myself in my best light to get recruited.

## Design process

When designing my portfolio, I looked at other people's portfolio and made a design which I thought looked proffessional and minimalistic. On the very top of the page is a navigation bar for users to access other parts of my HTML.

## Features
